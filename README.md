Simple script to update tunlr gatekeeper stuff


Because I'm sometimes blessed with an changing ip address I wrote this nice script, it will function on most Linux systems.

To run the script simply get https://raw.github.com/FriedZombie/tunlrUpdater/master/gatekeeper/gatekeeperUpdate
and make the downloaded file executable and change the settings in the script itself to suit your needs.
When the script is ran, it updates your public ip to tunlr gatekeeper.
